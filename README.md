# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-USING-CNN-ARCHITECTURE
 Developed a CNN model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify grayscale handwritten digits (0-9). Created a custom dataset with 200 training and 60 testing images per digit. Used data augmentation for better generalization, achieving 79% accuracy. Built a Tkinter GUI for real-time digit recognition.
