# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION-USING-CNN-ARCHITECTURE
 Developed a CNN model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras to classify grayscale handwritten digits (0-9). Created a custom dataset with 200 training and 60 testing images per digit. Used data augmentation for better generalization, achieving 79% accuracy. Built a Tkinter GUI for real-time digit recognition.
Our project aims to recognize handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically designed for accurate classification of grayscale images representing digits from 0 to 9. The CNN model was built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging several convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to extract and learn features effectively.
Dataset Details:
A custom dataset was created to suit the needs of this project, allowing for a tailored approach to digit recognition. The dataset contains:
Training Data: Divided into 10 subfolders (one for each digit from 0 to 9) with 200 grayscale images per digit. These images were resized to 64x64 pixels to match the input dimensions of the CNN model.
Testing Data: Divided similarly into 10 subfolders with 60 images per digit, allowing for a robust testing phase to evaluate model performance.
The dataset images were processed using ImageDataGenerator to implement real-time augmentation. Augmentation techniques included brightness adjustment, zooming, width shifting, and shearing, enhancing the model's ability to generalize over variations in handwriting styles.
In the Model Training Code, we begin by setting up paths to the custom dataset, consisting of grayscale images divided into training and testing directories, each with subfolders for digits 0 through 9. The images are resized to 64x64 pixels, and ImageDataGenerator is used for real-time data augmentation, applying transformations like brightness adjustment, zooming, width shifting, and shearing to improve generalization. A CNN model is then defined with multiple convolutional and pooling layers to extract spatial features, followed by dense layers for classification, with softmax output for 10-digit classes. The model is trained over 30 epochs, and finally, it is evaluated on the testing set to determine accuracy, then saved locally for future use.
The GUI Application Code loads this pre-trained model to provide real-time digit recognition through a simple interface built with Tkinter. Upon running the application, users can select an image of a handwritten digit using a file dialog. The image is preprocessed to match the training dimensions (64x64 pixels) and normalized. The model then predicts the digit, and the result is displayed in the GUI along with the uploaded image. This interactive system enables easy, on-the-go digit classification using the trained CNN model.
